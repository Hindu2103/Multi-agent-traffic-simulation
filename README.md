# Multi-Agent Traffic Simulation

A **Python-based traffic simulation** using **Tkinter** for GUI and simple agent-based modeling.

## Description
This project simulates cars as agents moving along a road and obeying traffic lights.  
- Cars stop at red lights and move when green.  
- Traffic lights cycle automatically.  
- Tracks wait times of cars.  
- Demonstrates **agent-based modeling, OOP, and GUI programming**.  
- Can be extended with multiple intersections, dynamic traffic control, and optimization algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive Tkinter GUI
- Moving car agents
- Traffic light with green/red cycles
- Cars obey traffic rules
- Easy to extend and modify

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Save `traffic_sim.py` to your local machine.
3. Open the file in IDLE or any Python IDE.
4. Press **F5** or run the module.
5. Enjoy the simulation! Click **Stop Simulation** to exit.

## Future Enhancements
- Add adjustable green/red timings with sliders
- Multiple lanes and intersections
- Implement optimization algorithms (GA/PSO) for traffic lights
- Track and display statistics like average waiting time
